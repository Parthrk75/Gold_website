          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Supply and Demand in the Gold Market</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Mining Output:</strong> Gold is limited in supply; less output means higher prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Jewelry & Industry:</strong> High demand in jewelry, especially during festivals, can increase prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Demand:</strong> When investors buy gold (especially through ETFs), prices go up.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">When demand increases but supply remains tight, gold prices naturally rise. Simple economics.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Economic Factors That Influence Gold Prices</h2>
          <p className="mb-2"><strong>Inflation:</strong> Gold acts as a shield when inflation rises, making it a go-to for investors.</p>
          <p className="mb-2"><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Higher rates make other assets more attractive than gold. Lower rates push people toward gold.</p>
          <p className="mb-2"><strong>Currency Value:</strong> A strong dollar makes gold costlier for other countries, reducing demand.</p>
          <p className="mb-4"><strong>Stock Market Movements:</strong> When stocks crash, gold often becomes a safe option, pushing prices up.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Global Events & Political Tensions</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Gold is a "safe haven" asset. So whenever the world feels uncertain, people buy gold â€” a lot of it.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>War or Conflict:</strong> Escalating tensions spike demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Recession:</strong> Investors rush to gold when markets fall.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandemics or Natural Disasters:</strong> Disruption boosts fear, and fear boosts gold buying.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Investor Sentiment & Market Psychology</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Sometimes, itâ€™s not about numbers â€” itâ€™s about how people feel.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Traders betting on price movement cause quick shifts.</li>
            <li><strong>News Headlines:</strong> A single report can create panic or excitement.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital & Algorithmic Trading:</strong> Prices can change in seconds due to AI-powered systems.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. How Gold Prices Are Determined Daily</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Gold is traded globally 24/7. Prices are set based on futures trading on major exchanges like the COMEX (New York), London Metal Exchange, and others.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Live Spot Price:</strong> The current market value of gold, updated in real-time based on trade volume.</li>
            <li><strong>Futures Contracts:</strong> Investors bet on the future price of gold, impacting current trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Makers:</strong> Large institutions that influence liquidity and price consistency.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Thereâ€™s no one reason gold prices move daily â€” itâ€™s a combination of supply, economy, fear, and speculation. But now you know what to look out for!</p>
          <p className="mb-4">Understanding these factors can help you make smarter choices, whether you're buying, investing, or just keeping an eye on the market.</p>
