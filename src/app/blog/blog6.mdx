          {/* Intro */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If youâ€™ve ever shopped for gold, youâ€™ve likely come across 22K and 24K gold. While they might sound similar, they have important differences that can affect your purchase â€” especially whether you're buying for jewelry, gifting, or investment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Letâ€™s break down the distinctions so you can make an informed decision when buying gold in 2025.
          </p>

          {/* Gold Karat System */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Understanding the Karat System</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The karat (K) system measures the purity of gold out of 24 parts. The higher the karat, the purer the gold. This system helps buyers know the percentage of actual gold in a piece.
          </p>

          {/* Purity Comparison */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Gold Purity: What Do Karats Mean?</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>24K Gold:</strong> 99.9% pure gold, often referred to as pure gold. It has a bright yellow color and is the highest grade.</li>
            <li><strong>22K Gold:</strong> Contains 91.6% gold and 8.4% other metals like silver, copper, or zinc, making it more durable.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* Durability */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Durability & Usage</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            While 24K is the purest, itâ€™s also the softest â€” making it unsuitable for regular jewelry wear. On the other hand, 22K gold strikes a balance between purity and strength.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>22K:</strong> Ideal for jewelry like rings, bangles, and chains. Less likely to bend or scratch with daily use.</li>
            <li><strong>24K:</strong> Mostly used for gold coins, bars, and investment purposes. Too soft for intricate jewelry designs.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* Price Difference */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Price Difference</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Since 24K gold is purer, it's naturally more expensive per gram than 22K gold. The price gap can vary daily based on the gold market.

          {/* Appearance */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Color & Look</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            24K gold has a richer, deeper yellow hue compared to 22K, which may appear slightly duller due to alloying metals. While some people love the vibrancy of 24K, others prefer the subtler shine of 22K jewelry.
          </p>

          {/* Investment Value */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Investment Perspective</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Investors usually prefer 24K gold because of its purity and liquidity. Itâ€™s easier to sell internationally and carries higher resale value, especially in the form of government-minted coins or certified bars.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            However, 22K gold jewelry can also serve as a dual-purpose asset â€” both wearable and tradable, though with slightly lower resale returns due to making charges.
          </p>

          {/* Hallmarking */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Look for BIS Hallmarking</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In India and many countries, BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) hallmarking is used to certify gold purity. Always check for a hallmark stamp to ensure you're getting the karat value you're paying for.
          </p>

          {/* Which One to Choose */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Which One Should You Buy?</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Buy 24K if:</strong> Youâ€™re investing in gold bars or coins and prefer high purity.</li>
            <li><strong>Buy 22K if:</strong> Youâ€™re purchasing jewelry for regular use and need durability with good purity.</li>
          </ul>

          {/* Conclusion */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The right choice depends on your purpose. For pure investment, 24K gold is unmatched. But for wearable elegance, 22K offers strength and style.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before making a decision, compare prices and consider your needs. Either way, gold remains a timeless asset in 2025.
