  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-yellow-600">How Is the Daily Gold Rate Calculated?</h1>

  <p className="mb-4">
    Ever wonder how the gold price you see every morning is actually determined? It‚Äôs not random ‚Äî it‚Äôs based on a mix of international market dynamics, currency fluctuations, and local factors. Let‚Äôs break down how the daily gold rate is calculated, especially in countries like India.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. International Gold Price</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    The most important factor in gold price calculation is the global spot price, which is traded in US dollars (USD). This rate is decided by major international exchanges such as the:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li>London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)</li>
    <li>COMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange)</li>
    <li>Shanghai Gold Exchange</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="mb-4">
    These platforms consider live trading, demand, and supply to set a benchmark price twice daily, known as the ‚Äúgold fix.‚Äù
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. USD to INR Conversion</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Since gold is priced in USD globally, the exchange rate plays a key role in converting the price for the Indian market. If the rupee weakens against the dollar, gold becomes costlier, and vice versa.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Import Duties and Taxes</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    India imports most of its gold, so the government‚Äôs import duties directly impact the price. Currently, these include:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li>Basic Customs Duty (BCD)</li>
    <li>Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC)</li>
    <li>Goods and Services Tax (GST) ‚Äì added on top at retail level</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Demand and Supply in Domestic Market</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Festivals, wedding seasons, and investor behavior create demand surges, pushing up prices. Similarly, low demand can reduce local premiums.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Central Bank Policies</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other global central banks influence gold pricing indirectly. If interest rates are high, gold demand might fall, and if inflation rises, gold demand often surges.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Local Jewellers‚Äô Association</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    In India, city-level jewellers‚Äô associations (like in Mumbai, Delhi, or Hyderabad) finalize the daily retail gold rate based on the above factors and add a margin for making and logistics.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Example Calculation</h2>
  <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li>International Spot Price (24K): $2,200/oz</li>
    <li>1 oz = 31.1 grams ‚áí $2,200 √∑ 31.1 = $70.74/gram</li>
    <li>USD/INR = ‚Çπ83.50 ‚áí ‚Çπ70.74 √ó 83.5 = ‚Çπ5,908/gram</li>
    <li>Add Import Duty + GST + Local Margin = Final Retail Price (‚Çπ6,300‚Äì‚Çπ6,600/gram)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why It Changes Daily</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    Gold prices fluctuate daily due to:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
    <li>Real-time trading on global exchanges</li>
    <li>Fluctuating INR-USD rates</li>
    <li>Shifts in import policies</li>
    <li>Demand during festivals or economic events</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    The gold rate isn‚Äôt just a number ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reflection of global markets, government policy, and local demand. As an investor or buyer, keeping an eye on all these moving parts helps you make smarter decisions.
